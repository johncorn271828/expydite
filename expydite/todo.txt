MutableConsList:
    Circular lists?
ConsList:
    all done with features? what was it I forgot? heaps or something? Functional array-like thing?
    Race _equal_cdrs vs tco(==) in tail recursion of _eq
    Circular lists?
RBNode:
    Have insert/delete indicate whether size changed?
    RBSharedNode class, tests
RBSet:
    Think about add/discard without calling __contains__
    reimplement collections.abc auto methods with shitty implementations
    Write tests that show it mimicks set formally: RBSet(a op b) == RBSet(a) op RBSet(b)
RBDict:
    Think about __setitem__/__delitem__ without calling __getitem__
    reimplement collections.abc auto methods with shitty implementations
    Write tests that show it mickicks dict formally
SharedRBSetNode
SharedRBSet
SharedRBDictNode
SharedRBDict
pmap object (lazy) etc
